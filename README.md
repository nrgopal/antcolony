PARAMETER-TUNING FOR EFFICIENT PROGRAM EXECUTION THROUGH ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION

Abstract:

As high-performance hardware architectures grow in power and complexity, especially in
parallel processing platforms, choosing optimal parameters for efficient program execution can
be a challenge. There are many tunable factors that affect the speed of execution of a program
and how much power the execution consumes: compiler options, compiler flags, cache block
sizes, number of threads, etc. The number of combinations of parameters can grow exponentially
so that a brute-force approach to find the best possible set of parameters may be prohibitively
expensive. In this project, we propose an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) solution. ACO is well
suited for discrete optimization problems and has been successfully applied in many
applications, especially those related to finding shortest paths, optimal schedules, best vehicle
routing, etc. The success of ACO hinges on a well-tuned strategy to incrementally promote good
solutions and penalize poor ones in the search process. We show how the performance of the
ACO varies with different settings of the algorithm and search strategies. We obtain significant
improvement when the ACO is extended to update a varying number of neighboring paths, like in
simulated annealing. We also compare our results to other approaches, including baseline
performances based on other algorithms and also one based on Particle Swarm Optimization.
